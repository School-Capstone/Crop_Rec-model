# Crop Recommendation System using TensorFlow

## Project Overview

The Crop Recommendation System using TensorFlow is a machine learning project that helps farmers make data-driven decisions about which crops to cultivate on their farms. This system leverages the power of deep learning and TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning library, to provide crop recommendations based on various environmental and soil parameters.

## Getting Started

This section provides a brief overview of how to get started with the Crop Recommendation System using TensorFlow.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and experimenting with the project)
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:nkusikevin/Crop_Rec-model.git
   ```

2. Change your directory to the project folder:

   ```
   cd Crop_Rec-model
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv crops
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```
     crops\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source crops/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The Crop Recommendation System consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Collection:** You will need to gather data about soil properties, weather conditions, and crop details in your specific region. This data will be used for training and making recommendations.

2. **Model Training:** Train the machine learning model using your dataset. You can do this by running the Jupyter Notebook provided in the project.

3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance to ensure it provides accurate crop recommendations.

4. **Deployment:** Deploy the model as a web application or integrate it into your farming management software for practical use.

## Data

To create a useful Crop Recommendation System, you need relevant data. In this project, we assume you have access to soil data, weather data, and historical crop yields for your region. The data should be organized and preprocessed before training the model.

## Model Architecture

The core of the Crop Recommendation System is the deep learning model. In this project, we use a neural network architecture designed to predict the best crop based on the input data. The architecture may include:

- Input Layer
- Multiple Hidden Layers
- Output Layer

The model is trained using TensorFlow and optimized to make accurate crop recommendations.

## Training

To train the model:

1. Prepare and preprocess your dataset.
2. Open the `predictionmodel.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your data, create and train the model, and save the trained model.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Make sure the model provides reliable crop recommendations based on your data.

## Deployment

Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it for practical use. Possible deployment options include:

- Creating a web application that takes user input and returns crop recommendations.
- Integrating the model into a farming management software system.
- Making it available as a service accessible via an API.
